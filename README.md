# Self-Driving-Simulation-using-CNN-NVIDIA-s-MODEL-Tensorflow

As per the NVDIA cnn model for self-driving car the model is created. First get the car simulator for the training data and then testing after the model creation. The Tensorflow CNN model is created as proposed by NVDIA and got a pretty good ouput. Mail me for more information about it - agnishwar29@gmail.com
